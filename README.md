# Wine Classification Analysis

**Task: Wine Classification**

We are tasked to produce a machine learning model that classifies Wines. We have been given a dataset with 13 variables that are used in classifying the Wines, and it would be ideal to produce a model with fewer variables. If we can produce a model with only 2 variables, we can visually observe the predictive regions and boundaries. In addition, evaluate the model and perform parameter tuning to improve the model.

Therefore, we will be producing a machine learning model to classify Wines using "Dimensionality Reduction", "K-Fold Cross Validation" and "Grid Search" for model evaluation and tuning.

## Dimensionality Reduction

There are two types of Dimensionality Reduction techniques, they are:

- Feature Selection
- Feature Extraction

Feature Selection techniques include "Backward Elimination", "Forward Selection", "Bidirectional Elimination", "Score Comparison" ... etc. For the dataset under study, we will be using Feature Extraction techniques listed below:

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Kernel Principal Component Analysis (Kernel PCA)
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
